# My Portfolio Site

This project is a fully custom portfolio and personal site for myself. The whole site was designed and implemented by me. The goal was to make a site that I could show people about my work as well as getting more familiar with the React JavaScript framework.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Design

The website was designed using the free UI design software [Figma](http://figma.com). The goal of the design was to create something cool looking that clearly showed my portfolio and skills while showing my interests like code, space, and design. The overall look and feel of the design is inspired visual studio code’s look and the layout is inspired but different to other portfolio projects I have seen on the internet.

The fonts used for this project is [Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter) and [Consolas](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/consolas).

Figma design for the skills cards.

## Implementation

For this project, I chose to write it in React. I chose this because most of my projects are in Angular and I wanted some experience in the also popular framework of React. This was to test how quickly I could adapt to a new tool and language (jsx) as I hasn’t used React since sophomore year of college.

All of the styles used for the website are made by myself with CSS based on what I designed in the Figma.

### Orbit Animation

The orbit animation on the right of the home page is the part that took the most work by itself. The animation uses a custom `<canvas>` element component that changes the rendered image based on the percentage of the scroll height. The canvas also preloads the images to improve the performance when scrolling.

## Running the Project

### Development server

In the project directory, you can run:

### Code scaffolding

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### Build

### `npm test`

### Running unit tests

### `npm run build`

### Running end-to-end tests

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### Further help

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
